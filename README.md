# OnePromise

One of the Promises in Swift world just for fun :-)

## Features

- Swift 2.0
- No dependencies and fits into one file

## Installation

1. Copy `OnePromise.swift` into your project.
2. The `Promise` class is one and only one public. If you dislike, rename it as you want.

## Installation (CocoaPods)

OnePromise is also available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
platform :ios, "8.0"
use_frameworks!

pod "OnePromise"
```

In order to use CocoaPods, you must explicity include `use_frameworks!` and specify
`platform :ios` version to 8.0 at minimum.

Read [CocoaPods blog entry](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-0.36/) for
